Added the additional key of "courses_year". 
Added functionality to retrieve lat/lon from skaha server.
Contributed to the complete refactoring of our parse5 functions to properly handle async tasks.
Contributed to retrieve rooms information from index.htm.
Added many test cases which caught bugs in our code.
Fixed our output to match the expected output from the UI. This was able to bump our mark up by 20%

We paired programmed again for this deliverable and I think that worked well for the both of us. We were
able to complement each other's skill set and figure things out quicker than we would have by ourselves.
I think maintaining and enhancing the codebase was difficult due to design issues in the first phase.
This is something that we could have improved on. I think we are doing our best in this respect to continue
forward with the project.
