I filtered for the parse5 information and made everything fit the initial d1 input so filter would work. I added alot of tests to our test suites. We refactored our index.htm retrieval together to make sure adddataset worked. We did a lot of pair programming so it is a mix bag of work. I found a lot of bugs .
