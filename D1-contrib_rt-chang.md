I contributed to the implementation of addDataset by figuring out how to load files and handling the promises in order to cache
the data. Additionally I created the framework of the recursive strucutre for performQuery and helped to implement GT, LT, EQ
and IS. I also helped to create test cases and deal with a number of exceptions.

My partner and I pair programmed as much as possible. So our commits generally reflect both our efforts. 

I think that we need to spend more time in planning our approach in order to not get lost in our code. I need to be able to better
understand the problems at hand and what we are trying to solve. A lot of times, it took me a while until I fully understood
what I was trying to accomplish
