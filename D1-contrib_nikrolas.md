We should of spent more time thinking about the structure of the program before jumping into implementation. We spent a lot of time refactoring our code because we thought of other better and clearer ways to make our program more robust. It was difficult to get started because, even though we read the promises documentation, getting everything to function was hard. After that, it was smoother sailing because we at least had a base to work off of. For the next one, we should talk things out more to get a clear idea of what needs to be accomplished.
